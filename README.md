# Hi, I'm Natalie

## About Me 
I'm a senior at the University of Notre Dame majoring in political science and minoring in Chinese and data science. This semester, I took a data science course where we learned how to use Github to showcase our projects and assignments.

## Research Interests 🌱
- I am interested in using quantitative methods and data analysis to evaluate political topics. 

## Research Experience 📚 
- Current project: Research assistant in the Notre Dame political science department working on a project on the impact of women's suffrage on legislative outcomes.
- Past projects:
    - Research assistant studying the representation of women on local government boards (November 2023 - December 2024)
    - Research assistant analyzing the nationalization of US politics through evaluating candidate platforms on various political issues (May 2023 - August 2023)
    - Senior thesis in political science using linear regression models created in R to evaluate how party identification influences consumer preferences in America (August 2024 - April 2025)
