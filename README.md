# Hi, I'm Natalie

## About Me 
I'm from the greater Chicago area and am currently a senior at the University of Notre Dame majoring in political science and minoring in Chinese and data science.  I am interested in using quantitative methods and data analysis to evaluate political topics, especially related to the behavior of individuals and United States politics.

## Related Coursework üè´ 
- **Introduction to Data Science**: This semester, I took a data science course where we learned how to use Github to showcase our projects and assignments. These projects developed and strengthened skills including making [Unsupervised](https://github.com/nataliebock/Bock-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/MLUnsupervisedApp/README.md) and [Supervised](https://github.com/nataliebock/Bock-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp) machine learning Streamlit apps, and learning how to apply [tidy data principles](https://github.com/nataliebock/Bock-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project) to data cleaning for exploratory data analysis.
  
- **Visualizing Politics**: Conducted a semester-long project evaluating the impact of campaign finance on the incumbent advantage in U.S. Congress. The course focused on how to use **data visualizations** created in **R** to craft an argument and analysis.

- **Quantitative Political Analysis**: Applied statistical concepts and data analysis to American political science concepts using R. These included programming and evaluating Hypothesis Testing, Probabilities, and Bivariate and Multivariate Regression models.
   - **Final Project:** Evaluating the characteristics of Americans who donate to political campaigns through linear regression models. Evaluated factors including education and income. 

- **Elements of Computing**: Introductory course in Python. Learned about the ethics of data collection and analysis.
